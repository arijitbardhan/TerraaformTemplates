# TerraformTemplates
Terraform templates for various requirements

To run the templates
--------------------------
-> Install Terraform on your system (Guide: https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html)

-> Download the file. (**IMPORTANT: Download the variables file too and place it into same directory as the .tf file**)

-> Run 'terraform plan' to get an idea of what is to be deployed. Put in the variable values when asked to.

-> Finally run 'terraform apply'. Put the values when asked. This time the infrastructure would be deployed on particular provider.
